<h2> basic background information</h2> 

<p>I’m a 30 year old stay at home dad, I’m ADHD so I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life up until now, it takes us a bit longer to understand and know wants and needs. I’m a pretty old school person as I don’t fit in with the gen Z way of living and sugar coating everything in the world. I believe the world is a harsh place and you have to work hard for your goals.</p> 

<h2>nationality and culture</h2> 

<p>I’m Australian born, Aboriginal runs through my DNA and I’m proud to identify. I’m also English and Scandinavian, which I’m also equally proud of.</p> 

<h2>education to date</h2> 

<p>I’ve finished year 12 and done a cert 3 in warehousing, cert 2 in business, cert 2 in health and safety practices. Other than that I've never really done anything else with myself. </p> 

<h2> Languages</h2> 

<p>I speak fluent English and beginner-Intermediate in Spanish as I’m still currently learning.</p> 

<h2>Include at least one fact about yourself that others  
may find interesting, such as a hobby, a pet or your favourite sport or other pastime.</h2> 

<p>The most interesting fact about me that a lot of people seem to have the same opinion is I'm very humble and kind despite being covered in tattoo’s and looking like I'd punch everyone. 

I played Football(soccer) growing up and played State futsal, I've since lost the drive and passion as I became a father it slowly left my life. Now I'm a gamer, father and own an Indian ringneck Parrot who is my best friend. </p> 

 

 

                                                         <h1>Interest in IT</h1> 

 

<h2>What is your interest in IT?</h2> 

<p>My interest in I.T is learning to create and build objects or programs to hit life goals in a field I’m super comfortable with and something I've been comfortable with most of my life as using a PC has become second nature to me.</p> 

 

<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2> 

<p>My dad started showing me bit and pieces of computing when I was around 12-13 and it has developed into the last 18 years of owning a PC and using it nearly everyday and trying to learn increasingly more, which brings me to this course.</p> 

 

<h2>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2> 

<p>My Father. He would show me all these cool things you can do on a PC and he’d create his own websites and taught himself to code, to hack, how to create servers for games and just all round basic pc knowledge, he has been a huge inspiration into the I.T world and I'd like to make a career out of what he has taught me and what I can learn from RMIT. </p> 

 

<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2> 

<p>It kind of just happened, I was looking for courses online to make a career for myself and I stumbled across RMIT and just felt like it was the right course for me to be in, almost like I was drawn to the university.</p> 

 

 <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2> 

<p>I’d hopefully learn the basics of the computing world if not a little bit more than basic, as I'd really enjoy a career in this field. I want to learn how every little detail can create an app or webpage and hopefully learn a lot more that will help me in my future of I.T.</p> 

 

 

 

 

                                                               <h1>IDEAL JOB</h1> 

 

 <h2>The job advertisement itself. Include a link, and a snapshot of it.</h2> 

<p>I’ve chosen IT support as I'd like to be able to help people in a company who know little about the computing world. This is an ideal job I'd be after as I enjoy helping others.</p>

 <h2>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h2> 

<p>The position is a support desk job for IT and fixing issues that some staff members may stumble across on their everyday use of computers. It appeals to me because it’s a full time employment and as mentioned before it would provide me with comfortability as I enjoy using pc’s and I would enjoy helping fix peoples problems.</p>

With hands on experience with Microsoft Exchange and experience with Windows Server.</p> 

 <h2>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h2> 

<p>At this current point in time the only experience I have is home use of some of the requirements they’re asking for with no professional experience or qualifications.</p> 

 <h2>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h2> 

<p>I’m in this course to try and obtain the skills required for this role and gain experience and knowledge to not only secure a job in the future but pursue a career.</p> 

<h2>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h2> 

<p>My plan is currently underway to obtain the skills and qualifications needed to be able to do a position such as the one above.</p>

<h2> What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2> 

<p>I find these results are quite accurate with my personality traits and the typing test is something fun I thought I could throw in there as it can contribute to the I.t world by helping me type faster and located the keys by feel of their placement of the board.</p> 

  
<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h2> 

<p>Unlikely to be a problem in my opinions as I am incredibly open about things, not afraid to put my 2 cents in but also prefer to be a solo flyer, when possible, with that being said, i would still contribute to my team and strive for the best outcome possible for us.</p> 

 
<h2> How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2> 

 <p>I’m always open minded for other people as long as we have an agreed common goal, anything else is just an obstacle that we can overcome. I’d like to achieve a team that is comfortable with speaking up and letting their voice be heard with their ideas. But I also want to take hold of the reins to express my opinions and push for the best result for the team.</p> 

 

                                               <h1>Project Idea</h1> 

<p>For my project idea, I've decided to go with a basic app that would be based around the history of Indigenous Australians and their culture I.e, tools, weapons, ingenuity and musical instruments, languages spoken at the time and practices that helped them survive during a time before technology and how it affected their day to day life. 
 

My motivation is that in the modern era of technology, we are forgetting where we came from, for me it is overly important as I am of aboriginal descent and I wish I had the opportunity to learn these things more growing up. I was taught bits and pieces but it wasn’t enough to really appreciate where I'd be without that historical connection.</p>  
 
<h2>Description (500 words) - Detailed description of the features of the product or service</h2>  

<p>The basic concept for my idea would be an app where you can have a drop down bar to select the options for either a “tool” column or a “weapon” column even a “survival” column, Which would then take you to another page depending on what you’ve selected with pictures of what the “tool or weapon” would be with a description of it plus the services it would provide. Would also have a page for history for people to have a read of the history of the Aboriginal people of Australia. 

I would make the service have an option to link videos with displays of how tools and basic instructions for tool usage and survival tips with also mp3 links to hear the sounds of the music that would have been made by indigenous Australians so people could not only read about it but hear it too, I would then have another tab that would be for language and show the languages in a list format (as there was over 160) that were around at that time. A final page that would be added would be another tab labelled “Local information” and use a postcode-based algorithm to show indigenous groups in the local area so people may attend to in order to be involved with indigenous groups in the local community. 

I’d also add in an area that would show the tragic history of genocide in Australia and the loss of our peoples great accomplishments in the 60,000 years they survived before technology was introduced and the changes of trying to “breed” the black out of Australia. 

At the bottom of every page would be an indigenous support number to help those in need if they are struggling with homelessness or hunger and provide a external “help page” that I would link to an E-mail (mine or a dependable contact) that can assist people with help with whatever it may be.</p> 

 
 
<h2>Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include  
any relevant open source tools as appropriate. </h2> 

<p>I’ve searched on google on how to create an app and have found an interesting tool that I think would be great to help create an app for my project idea. For the hardware used I'd use my pc and code using java. Here is some more information of requirements 

 

Hardware requirements 

Your development workstation should meet or exceed these hardware requirements: 

A 64-bit environment is required for Android 2.3.x (Gingerbread) and higher versions, including the master branch. You can compile older versions on 32-bit systems. 

At least 250GB of free disk space to check out the code and an extra 150 GB to build it. If you conduct multiple builds, you need additional space. 

With some software Requirements here: 

Software requirements 

The AOSP master branch is traditionally developed and tested on Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, but other distributions may be used. See Establishing a Build Environment for additional required packages and the commands to install them. 

Your workstation must have the software listed below. These requirements apply to the AOSP master branch. For Android versions 8.0 (Oreo or O) through 5.0 (Lollipop or L), consider using the included Dockerfile to ease installation of all required packages. For the manual method, see Supporting Older Versions.</p> 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

<p>The skills required would be some knowledge in coding which can be learnt online for free and there are some free to use development apps via google that would help find the information needed to create such an app. A co-worker would most likely be required to take some of the grunt work and assist you in your app development which would in turn give another opinion on the idea.  

I think that overall it would be very simple to follow instructions on google videos and you would end up with a great app, I looked for software on google and found so many that were available.</p> 
 
<h2>Outcome (100 words) - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be  
solved? What impact will this development have?</h2> 

<p>If my project were to successful I think it would have a great impact on the indigenous youth being able to learn more about their ancestors and how they survived using the limited tools and weapons available at that time. Which would in turn give them a greater knowledge on who they are and what their people have been through and how they overcame basic materials in order to survive and I find that it would be a great learning curve for a lot of people who would like to brush up on history in order to obtain a greater knowledge of the history of Australia and it’s first peoples.</p>
